Here's an updated version of the README.md file that includes sections for images showcasing the results of your operations. You can replace the image file names with the actual images once you have them ready:

Grayscale Image Processing Operations
This repository contains MATLAB scripts that perform various image processing tasks on grayscale images, including brightness adjustment, contrast manipulation, negative image creation, and arithmetic operations between two images.

Features
Brightness Adjustment: Increase or decrease the brightness of a grayscale image.
Contrast Manipulation: Enhance or reduce image contrast using contrast stretching and normalization.
Negative Image Creation: Generate the negative of a grayscale image by inverting its pixel values.
Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two resized grayscale images.
Prerequisites
MATLAB installed on your system.
How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RAHULPATEL2002/grayscale-image-processing-operations.git
Open the .m files in MATLAB.
Replace the image paths with your own images or use the default ones.
Run the scripts to perform the various operations.

Conclusion :
 This lab provided insight into how simple mathematical operations on pixel values can dramatically change an imageâ€™s appearance. By adjusting brightness, contrast, and creating negative images, the effects of pixel intensity transformations were clearly understood. Furthermore, performing arithmetic operations on two grayscale images allowed for blending, comparison, and enhanced visualization of image differences. These foundational operations are essential for a variety of applications in digital image processing, such as image enhancement, filtering, and analysis.
